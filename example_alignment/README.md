# Example Alignments

Files:
 * `example_split_tex.ipynb` - uses TexSoup to mark the example tex file, instructions are given for recompiling the TeX
 * `example_ocr_and_align.ipynb` - does an example alignment of OCR/SGT results
 
Folders:
 * `example_tex/` gives a modified example of an article submitted to the arXiv in 2016 for marking.  Note: there is no .bib file, so the TeX can only be compiled with the provided .bbl file.
